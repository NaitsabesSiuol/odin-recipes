    <p>If you're a grilled chicken thigh and Asian food fan, you're in for a treat.</p>
    <p>This marinade has the perfect combination of savory-sweet-spicy-salty, and these juicy thighs will make your entire family happy.</p>
    <p>Serving suggestions would be jasmine rice, grilled or stir-fried veggies, or a chilled cucumber salad.</p>
    <p>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet GardenÂ®)</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, sesame oil, ginger, Sriracha, garlic, lime juice, and lemongrass paste together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Put chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over chicken, and marinate for 2 hours or overnight for an even better flavor.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken thighs from marinade, discarding marinade.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken thighs until they are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from grill and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
