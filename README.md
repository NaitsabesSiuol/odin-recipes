Creating a recipe website, with The Odin Project

First tried setting up a repository, then cloning it 
in my local machine using the command in the terminal using:
"git clone git@github:NaitsabesSiuol/odin-recipes.git"

When I need to add files into the repo I use the commands "git add ." then do "git commit -m "message"" to save the version of it

Once I need to push the commits I just use the "git push"

Finished with the CSS-Exercise foundation, I am now going to design these recipe pages.
